Contrary to what is defined in the CMSIS SVD standard, in `svdconv` the inheritance and adjustment of register sizes
follow a specific algorithm based on implicit and explicit size definitions at different levels. The calculation of the
***effective size*** involves both ***explicit definitions*** and ***inheritance*** from higher levels, following a
recursive approach to determine the ***maximum size*** within each level. Here's how the algorithm works:

For each peripheral, if clusters are present, they are resolved ***from the inside out***, starting with the innermost
clusters (where children are only registers). Each cluster is examined by iterating through all of its childrenâ€”either
***registers*** or ***subclusters***. The effective size for a register is either ***explicitly defined*** or
***inherited*** from a higher level, such as from the cluster, peripheral, or ultimately the device level. If no
explicit size is defined, it inherits the size from the levels above, taking the first size that is found while
traversing upwards. If this traversal reaches the device level and no size is defined there either, the size is set to
***32 bits*** by default.

For a given cluster, its size is determined by finding the ***maximum size*** among all of its children, including both
registers and subclusters.

This process is repeated ***recursively***, starting with the innermost clusters and moving outward to determine the
size of the parent clusters. Finally, the peripheral's size is calculated by taking the maximum size among all of its
direct children, including clusters and registers. This approach ensures that the effective size of a peripheral is
determined based on the largest size found in its entire hierarchy.

    This test examines how the parser handles more intricate scenarios of size inheritance and adjustments across

    of explicit and implicit size definitions. The parser must determine the correct effective sizes based on size
    inheritance rules and adjustments at different levels. In this case, the sizes within the clusters and
    registers are adjusted, either explicitly or inherited, following a recursive calculation of the maximum
    effective size.

    **Expected Outcome:** The parser should process the file without errors, correctly inheriting and adjusting sizes
    across clusters and registers. ClusterA, which has no explicit size defined, should have its size adjusted to
    64 bits, inherited from ClusterB and its child registers. Both `RegisterA` and `RegisterB` within ClusterA
    should also have effective sizes of 64 bits. Similarly, ClusterB should inherit a size of 64 bits from its
    children, while ClusterC, which also lacks an explicit size, should have a final size of 32 bits, based on its
    child registers, which inherit the size implicitly from device level (default value). Since the size
    adjustment for ClusterC is executed before the final size adjustment for PeripheralA, at this point of time,
    no size is set for PeripheralA. Finally, PeripheralA should adjust its size to 64 bits, reflecting the largest
    size found in its children. The parser should handle all these size adjustments and inheritance steps
    accurately, consistent with the behavior of `svdconv`.
